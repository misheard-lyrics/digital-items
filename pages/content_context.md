The materials in this digital library belong to the personal collection of Nora O'Sullivan, an Irish immigrant who first came to the United States of America during the early twentieth century. She was one of the over 6,000,000 Irish people who immigrated to what is today the US from the seventeenth through twenty-first centuries---shaping their new country's economy and culture in the process (McMahon & Costello-Sullivan, 2024, p. 1). Little is known about Nora outside of information found in her records and the living memories of those who spoke with her. Documentation indicates that she was born in Caherdaniel, Kerry County on March 30 of 1903 and came to the United States at least as early as 1922 at the age of 19.

Nora's great-nephew, the digital collection creator's father, recalls that she was a nurse who worked in Chicago, Illinois and most likely never married. This information corresponds with historical trends. Historians have noted that young and unwed women comprised a large number of Irish immigrants to the US, and that by entering the country's labor force, many of these immigrants acquired a greater degree of economic autonomy than previous generations of women (McCarthy, 2024, p. 300). Women entered workplaces in greater numbers during the decades prior to 1922. From 1870 to 1890, the number of women in the labor force doubled to one-sixth of its total, and Irish women were particularly well-represented in US industries including domestic services and textiles (McCarthy, 2024, p. 300). As an unmarried participant in the US workforce, Nora represents the period's increasing independence for women relative to previous years by obtaining a salary not managed by a husband.

Additionally, Nora's great-nephew believes that she lived for some time in Sedro-Woolley, Washington State, which is supported by a certificate for a naturalization course that she received in Seattle, Washington in 1939.

He also recalls that she spoke Irish and most likely English, came from a rural area, and had several cats. Her date of death is not known, but her records do not contain any materials from after the 1970s, indicating that she died during the decade. Though limited available information exists about Nora, her document collection demonstrates the international identities and connections maintained by immigrant communities. Writing about this phenomenon and using remittances sent to one's home country as an example, historian Howard Lune writes that "many immigrant communities are neither all here nor all there. The individual migrants live and work in their new country as active members of transnational community, with one foot on each shore" (Lune, 2020, p. 171). This concept applies well to Nora, whose documents (described in the following section) indicate ties to both the US and Ireland that remained strong throughout the entirety of her life.

## Contents

This repository contains an assortment of documents owned by Nora, which today serve as family records for her relatives. The materials range from 1922 to 1974 and originate from both Ireland and the US. Many of these documents are legal forms such as tax records sent from Ireland to Chicago. These items indicate that she maintained a residence in Ireland after immigrating to the US for work, and she payed rates---a tax on occupants in Irish buidlings. The periods of time that she lived in either the US or Ireland are unclear, though it seems likely that she had residences in both countries. Other legal forms include an Irish elector form and a document describing requirements for US visa applications---further demonstrating her ties to the two nations. Alongside such official documents, which were likely kept for practical purposes in case they were required by either government, Nora's collection includes a variety of objects maintained for seemingly sentimental reasons---indicating items that were important to her on a personal level. Such materials include stamps, photographs, and the passenger list from 1922. Most materials are in English and/or Irish. To browse these items, navigate to the Browse page. Below is a word cloud of some object types in the collection (for a more detailed version of this word cloud, navigate to the Material Types page).
